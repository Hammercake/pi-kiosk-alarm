TODO
	Speech will not be a module anymore.
		Add Speech directly into the system.
		Modules can add sentences to the speech by using a global function.
		Speech can be enabled in the app config.
	News module
		Images too large, 1st gen Pi with low memory is sometimes struggling.
	Quotes module
		Sometimes doesn't return anything? Figure out a way to make it more reliable.
	
Future ideas
	Modular theme system
	Voice commands
	Digital clock attached to the Pi. So you can display the time without having the monitor opened all night.

Module ideas
	Radio streaming (delayed after Speech is done)
	Google Drive, load a specific document and show its content.

	Reddit (Doable via newsapi.org, just need to configure it)
	Comic (XKCD has an API)
