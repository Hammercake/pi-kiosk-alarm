!! This is a huge mess of random notes taken while figuring everything out. Need to make a real guide eventually. !!

- Useful commands -
Alt + F2, type "lxterminal"
sleep 10 && (command here)
sudo nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
crontab -e
	or -l to list scheduled crons

- Installing + SSH -
Latest version of Raspbian worked
Installed
Connect keyboard, setup network and wpa-supplicant config for wifi
Restart with delay, replace keyboard with wifi
Ping to given IP (192.168.0.155), get pinged back!
SSH works through Cygwin!

- Autologin -
I installed LightDM for the GUI.
Changed the config: https://wiki.debian.org/LightDM#Enable_autologin
Also this resource could be relevant: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LightDM#Enabling_autologin
Still doesn't work, now need to read about Xsession maybe?
Gave up, they all talk about the "lxsession" autostart configuration that I don't have, apparently Jessie Lite has no GUI and lightDM that I installed is just a desktop manager, not a desktop itself.
Going for full Jessie with Pixel desktop.
	WORKED. pi config just worked now.

- Control HDMI power -
Supposed to use libcec (https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec/blob/master/docs/README.raspberrypi.md)
Followed instructions, fails at step "make -j4" with following errors:
	src/libcec/CMakeFiles/cec.dir/build.make:77: recipe for target 'src/libcec/CMakeFiles/cec.dir/CECProcessor.cpp.o' failed
	make[2]: *** [src/libcec/CMakeFiles/cec.dir/CECProcessor.cpp.o] Interrupt

	make[1]: *** [src/libcec/CMakeFiles/cec.dir/all] Interrupt

	make: *** [all] Interrupt
Possibly use a pre-compiled version? https://drgeoffathome.wordpress.com/2015/08/09/a-premade-libcec-deb/
-OR-
Simply use tvservice:
	/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -p # Power on
	/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -o # Turn off
	/opt/vc/bin/tvservice -s # Status
-BETTER YET-
tvservice kills the windows when shutting down, so bringing it back up shows a blank screen.
Use this instead:
vcgencmd display_power 0
vcgencmd display_power 1

- Disable screen saver -

GOT IT. See autostart config

- Autostart config (launch chromium) -
sudo apt-get install chromium-browser
	now supported since sept 2016 instead of having to install plenty of crap
	FINALLY:
		Jessie creates a user autostart file, so the global file at /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart is not used.
		Add your changes to "/home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart".
	@sed -i 's/"exited_cleanly": false/"exited_cleanly": true/' ~/.config/chromium-browser/Default/Preferences
	@chromium-browser --disable-extensions --noerrdialogs --disable-infobars --kiosk --incognito http://localhost

- Setting APACHE (and PHP if necessary) -
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/apache.md
Had to fix the install since it d/c me in the middle of it. doing the apt-get again told me what command to run to fix it. Afterwards I re-ran the apt-get and it finally worked.
For PHP:
	sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 -y

- FTP -
Should work by default with SSH enabled. Use your fav ftp software and connect to the IP using SFTP with the user/pass

- CONTROLLING THE DISPLAY THROUGH SSH -
ssh -X pi@pi
export DISPLAY=":0"

- DAEMON SETUP SCRIPTS --
crontab -e	# edit schedules
crontab -l	# list stuff
scripts are currently located at:
	/home/pi/alarm_on.sh
	/home/pi/alarm_off.sh
Use this special command so PHP can call the script and not have to wait for chromium to close
	[COMMAND HERE] > /dev/null 2>/dev/null &

- STUFF TO DO ON NEW INSTALL -
Change apache to run as pi
	http://askubuntu.com/questions/391500/run-x11-gui-application-from-browser-apache-php
Set LXDE-pi to turn off monitor
